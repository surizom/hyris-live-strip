# Hyris live strip

This webapp is deployed on https://surizom.github.io/hyris-live-strip/

It was coded for real-time on-screen message displaying, during [Hyris](https://hyris.tv/) [Dernier DT P20 - DÃ®ner de vieux cons
](https://www.facebook.com/events/284593503120613/) live event.

Because of an experimental CSS property used (`scrollbar-width`), this only works on firefox 64+ for the moment
